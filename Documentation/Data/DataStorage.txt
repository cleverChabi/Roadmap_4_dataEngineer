DATA STORAGE OVERVIEW

What is Data Storage?
Data storage refers to the method of saving, organizing, and managing digital information. It is used in various applications such as cloud computing, data engineering, and IT infrastructure.

TYPES OF DATA STORAGE:
1. Primary Storage (RAM, Cache) - Fast, volatile memory used for running applications.
2. Secondary Storage (HDD, SSD) - Persistent storage for OS files and documents.
3. Cloud Storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage) - Scalable and cost-effective remote storage.
4. Network Storage (NAS, SAN, HDFS) - Distributed file storage over a network.
5. Object Storage (Amazon S3, Azure Blob) - Stores data as objects rather than files or blocks.
6. File Storage (Google Filestore, Amazon EFS) - Traditional hierarchical storage for files.
7. Block Storage (AWS EBS, Azure Disk) - High-performance storage for transactional workloads.

CHARACTERISTICS OF A STORAGE ACCOUNT:
1. SCALABLE - Supports large data volumes with on-demand scaling.
2. CHEAP - Cost-effective options like cold and archive storage.
3. HIGH PERFORMANCE - Low-latency access and fast data retrieval.
4. RELIABLE - Data replication ensures durability and availability.
5. REST API - Enables programmatic access and integration.
6. HIERARCHICAL - Allows structured organization with folders and subfolders.
7. SECURE - Encryption, access control, and IAM policies.
8. HADOOP COMPATIBLE - Supports Big Data processing tools like Hadoop and Spark.

WHY IS DATA STORAGE IMPORTANT?
- Reliability – Ensures data safety and accessibility.
- Scalability – Expands with business needs.
- Performance – Supports fast data access.
- Security – Provides encryption and access control.
- Cost-Efficiency – Different pricing tiers optimize cost.

Choosing the right storage solution depends on factors like scalability, cost, security, and performance.
