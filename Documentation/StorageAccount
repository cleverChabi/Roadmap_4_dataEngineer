# 📂 Characteristics of a Storage Account (Storage Files)

## 📌 1. SCALABLE
- The storage system must be **highly scalable**, capable of handling rapid increases in data volume.
- **Examples:**
  - **Azure Blob Storage**, **Amazon S3**, and **Google Cloud Storage** offer **near-infinite scalability**.
  - **HDFS** (Hadoop Distributed File System) distributes files across multiple nodes for distributed storage.

## 📌 2. CHEAP (Cost-Effective)
- The cost should be optimized to **store large volumes of data** efficiently.
- **Pricing models:**
  - **Cold storage** (e.g., **AWS S3 Glacier**, **Azure Cool Storage**) for rarely accessed data.
  - **Object storage** is often more cost-effective than traditional databases.

## 📌 3. HIGH PERFORMANCE
- Enables **fast access** to files, essential for **Big Data processing and Machine Learning**.
- **Optimizations:**
  - **SSD storage** for low-latency access.
  - **File partitioning** to improve throughput (e.g., Parquet, ORC).
  - **High-speed networks** to reduce data transfer latency.

## 📌 4. RELIABLE
- **Fault tolerance**: Files should be replicated across multiple servers.
- **Examples:**
  - **AWS S3** guarantees **99.999999999% durability** (11 nines).
  - **HDFS** stores multiple copies of files (default replication: x3).

## 📌 5. REST API
- The storage service should be **accessible via a REST API** to integrate with web applications and distributed systems.
- **Examples:**
  - **Azure Blob Storage API**
  - **Amazon S3 API**
  - **Google Cloud Storage API**
  - **MinIO API** (open-source, S3-compatible)

## 📌 6. HIERARCHICAL
- Allows files to be organized in a **hierarchical structure**:
  - 📁 Folders & subfolders (**like a traditional file system**).
  - Some systems use a **flat organization with prefixes** (e.g., **S3 does not have a true directory structure but simulates it with prefixes**).

## 📌 7. SECURE
- File security is critical, with multiple mechanisms:
  - **File encryption** (at rest and in transit).
  - **Authentication & Authorization**: IAM, ACLs, RBAC roles.
  - **Protection against accidental deletion** (e.g., AWS S3 versioning).

## 📌 8. HADOOP COMPATIBLE
- Compatible with the **Hadoop ecosystem** and Big Data frameworks (**Apache Spark, Hive, Presto, etc.**).
- **Examples of Hadoop-compatible storage:**
  - **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**
  - **S3 and Azure Data Lake with Hadoop connectors**
  - **Google Cloud Storage with Apache Hadoop Connector**
